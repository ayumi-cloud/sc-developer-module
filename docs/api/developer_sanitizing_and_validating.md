## Summer CMS Developer Validating and Sanitizing Data API

### Validating and Sanitizing

Sanitizing and validating user input is one of the most common tasks in a web application. To make this task easier Summer CMS provides a native filter module that you can use to sanitize or validate data.

Come common use cases for the module include cleaning the user input data for the frontend and backend forms, cleaning the data being read and written to the config files, cleaning the data being sent and recieved from the database, cookies, local and session storage etc.

The module also converts formats such as encoding and enconding. For example, an associative array into a JSON object.
